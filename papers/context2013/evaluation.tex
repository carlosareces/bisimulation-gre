\section{Human evaluation} \label{sec:evaluation}

We aisle the RE that our system gives another RE that not coincides with the one given by a human in the corpus, and with those realize a human evaluation in order to see if the RE produced by the system are prefered by human than the RE produced by humans. Two judges were asked by each pair of RE.

We have 43 pictures of furniture and 55 pictures of people, for wach of them we manually realize the referring expressions (including the properties given as results by our algorithm) and ask people to evaluate which one is a RE it is that univocally identifies the target object and wich one is better in sense that will be more usefull for a human who is not seeing the red box to identify the object. For do it we prepare a webpage with each of the pictures and 2 choices randomly ordered human and system RE. Out goal is to try to show if RE produced by our system are at less as good as the produced by human, and also we will show that they are even better.

%           & Agree in & Not agree & Total\\

%esta tabla no ayuda...no se que decir, no se como justificar que no coincidan...
%In the Table~\ref{agree-judges} we can see that the both judges choice the same RE 25 times for Furniture and 25 times for People, 

\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Judge    & Human choice & System choice & Total\\
\hline 
Judge1 & 10       & 33        & 43 \\
Judge2    & 11       & 32        & 43 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{System versus human selected choice for Furniture} 
\label{system-versus-human-furniture}
\end{center}
\end{table}

In the Table~\ref{system-versus-human-furniture} you can see the judges selected the RE generated by our system the 76\% of times in the case of pictures of furnitures.

\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Judge    & Human choice & System choice & Total\\
\hline 
Judge1 & 25       & 30        & 55 \\
Judge2    & 23       & 32        & 55 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{System versus human selected choice for People} 
\label{system-versus-human-people}
\end{center}
\end{table}

In the case of pictures of people you can see in the Table~\ref{system-versus-human-people} that the judges selected more RE generated by our system but the diference in not very significant.

\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
           & System & System \% & Human & Human \% & Total\\
\hline
Furniture & 23  & 0.92 &  2 & 0.08  & 25 \\
People    & 16  & 0.64 & 9  & 0.36 & 25 \\
Total     & 39  & 0.78    & 11 & 0.22 & 50  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Coincidences between judges, the system is the prefered the 78\% of times} 
\label{system-better}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Taking account just the coincidences between jugdes in average as you can see in the Table~\ref{system-better} they prefered the system in 78\% of times.

Sometimes comparison was unfair because human gives a RE that includes relation that were not annotated so, the system haven't the posibility of produce them. A point in favor of the system is that sometimes the human did an underespecified RE and the system has a better one.\\
