\section{Human evaluation} \label{sec:evaluation}

The algorithm give as results the properties to include in the RE, we manually realize the referring expressions and ask people to evaluate which one is better if the human produced or the system produced with more frequency. For do it we prepare a webpage with each of the pictures and 2 choices randomly ordered human and system RE, and ask to people which one will be more usefull to someone who doesn't see the target mark to identify it, as we see always people choose more the system than the human REs.\\

Sometimes comparison was unfair because human gives a RE that includes relation that were not annotated so, the system haven't the posibility of produce them. A point in favor of the system is that sometimes the human did an underespecified RE and the system has a better one.\\
