\section{Evaluation} \label{sec:evaluation}

In this section we present two different evaluations we performed on our algorithm. Section~\ref{sec:automaticevaluation} describes an evaluation with respect to the state of the art algorithm GRAPH~\cite{KrahmerGRAPH}. GRAPH was the top performer in both editions of the ASGRE, shared task~\cite{gatt-balz-kow:2008:ENLG}. Due to the limitations of the automatic metrics, in Section~\ref{sec:humanevaluation} we perform a human evaluation in  which we ask human subjects to compare the output produced by our algorithm to expressions produced by humans. 
  

\subsection{Automatic evaluation} \label{sec:automaticevaluation}

In this section we present the comparison of our algorithm to the state of the art algorithm GRAPH introduced above. The GRAPH algorithm is a deterministic algorithm and hence produces the same referring expression when run with the same target and model. Our algorithm is non deterministic, it may give a different referring expression each time it is run. In order to compare them we run our algorithm k times and we make a ranking of the top 20 produced referring expressions ordered by the frequency they were produced. We use the test part of the TUNA corpus to compare algorithm to the GRAPH algorithm whose results on this dataset are described in~\cite{KrahmerGRAPH} and reproduced in the Table~\ref{Tabla_sis_1_20}. 

The GRAPH algorithm defines the generation of referring expressions as a graph search problem, which outputs the cheapest distinguishing graph (if one exists) given a particular cost function. We compare to this algorithm using the metrics accuracy, Dice and \textsc{masi}. Accuracy is defined as the percentage of exact matches between each RE produced by a human and the RE produced by the system for the same scene. 

Dice coefficient is a set comparison metric, ranging between 0 and 1, where
1 indicates a perfect match between sets. For two
attribute sets A and B, Dice is computed as follows:\\

$Dice(A,B) = \frac{2\times|A \cap B|}{|A|+|B|}$\\


The \textsc{masi} score \cite{Passonneau06measuringagreement}~is an adaptation of the Jaccard coefficient
which biases it in favor of similarity where one set
is a subset of the other. Like Dice, it ranges between
0 and 1, where 1 indicates a perfect match. It is computed as follows:\\


$\textsc{masi}(A,B) = \delta \times \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}$ \\


where $\delta$ is a monotonicity coefficient defined as follows:


 \begin{equation}
     \delta  = \left\{
	       \begin{array}{ll}
		 0      & if A \cap B = \emptyset \\
		 1 & if A = B  \\
		 \frac{2}{3}     & if A \subset B ~or~ B \subset A\\
		 \frac{1}{3}     & otherwise
	       \end{array}
	     \right.
 \end{equation}


Intuitively, this
means that those system-produced descriptions are
preferred which do not include attributes that are
omitted by a human.  

In Table~\ref{Tabla_sis_1_20} we show the automatic metrics and compare the performance of our system  with the GRAPH system for the first RE in the ranking and the first 20 REs in the ranking.

Accuracy, Dice and \textsc{masi} assess humanlikeness with respect to a corpus of human referring expressions. In the Figure~\ref{graficoPresicion} the accuracy for our system and the GRAPH system is compared. The left GRAPH corresponds to the furniture domain and the right GRAPH corresponds to the people domain. We can see that taking the top 1 RE our system accuracy is lower than GRAPH performance for the people domain. However, if we consider the top 20 REs that our algorithm is able to produce we can see that the accuracy for both domains gets higher than 60\%. This shows that our algorithm is able to generate REs that are more similar to those produced by humans than the GRAPH algorithm, although these REs are not ranked first. 

Another result that we can observe is that the people domain accuracy is much lower for the top 1 RE than for the furniture domain (19 vs 47), but the accuracy stabilizes when REs lower in our ranking are considered. This may be explained by the fact that the training set for the people domain is smaller and less balanced and hence, the probabilities of use inferred do not generalize as well as in the furniture domain.

\subsection{Human evaluation} \label{sec:humanevaluation}

We asked two native speaker judges of English to evaluate our referring expressions via an experiment on the web. The authors of the paper did not participate during the evaluation. The judges could register to the evaluation system so that they did not have to complete it in one go, the could come back to it later. During the evaluation we showed each judge the scenes and two randomly ordered REs. One RE corresponded to the RE present in the corpus and produced by a person and the other RE corresponded to the top 1 RE produced by our system. We asked the judges to select the RE that would be more useful to identify the target in the scene. That is, to select it from among the other objects in the stimulus pictures. 

Our goal is to show that even if the RE generated by our algorithm does not coincide with the RE produced by a human in the corpus collection, it can be judged as good or even better than the REs generated by humans. 

In Table~\ref{system-versus-human} we show the results from the human evaluation experiment.
The REs produced by the system were considered equal or better by both
judges in 60 \% of the cases and, by at least one judge in 92\% of the cases.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}

\end{table}

Below, we illustrate the evaluation experiment by showing examples of cases in which the system expression was considered better by both judges, by only one judge or by neither of them. 

Figure~\ref{smallBlueFan} illustrates a case in which the human generated an underspecified RE while the system produced an RE which unequivocally identifies the target. The RE generated by the system for this figure is ``small blue fan'' while the RE produced by the human is ``blue fan''. The human RE fails to uniquely identify the target and is then not preferred by the human judges. Humans are known for producing underspecified REs which may be due to cognitive limitations for not being able to consider the whole referential context at the same time. Our algorithm is able to consider the whole referential context and combine this ability with the probability of use of the REs learned from humans. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{minipage}{0.48\linewidth}

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/smallBlueFan.jpg}

\label{BlueChair}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}


In Figure~\ref{BlueChair} the human RE was ``blue frontal chair'', and the system RE was ``the blue chair in the bottom''; both judges selected the system RE. This case can be explained by the fact that, in this domain, the property ``bottom'' helps more during the identification than the property ``frontal'' because it concentrates the attention of the interpreter in the lower part of the scene. Our system learns this fact by learning a higher value of \puse~for ``bottom'' than for ``frontal'' from the training data. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{minipage}{0.48\linewidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/s59t26.jpg}
\caption{Scene used during the collection of the TUNA corpus. The human  RE was \emph{the man with black hair}, and the system \emph{the man wearing glasses in the fourth column}. Judges prefer the human RE.}

\hspace*{.04cm}

\vspace*{-.3cm}
\caption{Scene used during the collection of the TUNA corpus. The human RE was \emph{man with a beard}, and the system \emph{man with a beard wearing glasses}. Judges did not agree in their preference.}
\label{s307t21}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{s28t25} is an example for which both judges preferred the human expression. The human  RE was ``the man with black hair'', and the system's ``the man wearing glasses in the fourth column''. This example makes evident the fact that, in the people domain some properties are more salient in some images than in others because of different shades of colors. Gradable properties such as this ones (in contrast to absolute properties) are still an open problem for GRE algorithms. 

Figure~\ref{s307t21}~illustrates a case in which the system RE was more overspecified than the human RE; the system included ``wearing glasses'' while the human did not. In this case one human subject preferred the system RE and the other the human RE. The amount of overspecification is a subjective matter where human themselves disagree. Further evaluation where REs are actually used for a task would be interesting to investigate this issue.
