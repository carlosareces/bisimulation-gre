\begin{abstract}
  This paper present an algorithm with a new form of adquire automatically reference expresion with overspecification and nondeterminism. We modify the algorithm described in~\cite{areces08} adding probabilities of use and discernibility extracted from a corpora in order to generate referential expresion like we see in a manual corpus of referential expresion. We will show how the algorithm can learn probabilities from the manual corpus of some picture make by~\cite{viethen} and use those probabilities in another pictures with similarity vocabulary with successfull results. We achieve \% precision and \% recall.
