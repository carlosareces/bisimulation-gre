Speakers are assumed to provide as much information as required for referent identification and no more, and listeners are believed to expect unambiguous but concise descriptions. In three experiments we examined the extent to which na\"{i}ve participants are sensitive to the Maxim of Quantity. The first was a production experiment which demonstrated that speakers over-describe almost one-third of the time. The second experiment showed that listeners do not judge over-descriptions to be any worse than concise expressions. The third experiment used the Visual World Paradigm to assess listeners' moment-by-moment interpretations of over-described utterances. This last experiment revealed that over-descriptions trigger eye movements that can be interpreted as indicating confusion. The results provide support for the use of a simple heuristic such as Minimal Attachment or Argument Saturation to create an initial parse. We conclude that people are only moderately Gricean.}},

    abstract = {{Presents an argument in 3 parts. 1st, it is shown by reference to the role of semantics in a transformational grammar that semantic decisions are not determined by either syntactic or semantic selection restrictions but by the speaker's knowledge of the intended referent. 2nd, it is shown that current theories of word-referent relations are inadequate to specify the grounds for the above-mentioned semantic decisions. Finally, by the use of a paradigm case, a theory of reference in terms of a cognitive theory of semantics is advanced in which it is shown that a semantic decision, i.e., the choice of a word, is made so as to differentiate an intended referent from some perceived or inferred set of alternatives. The implications include an altered conception of meaning, a statement of the relative information in words and in pictures, a hypothesis about the redundancy of the postulation of deep structure, and revised conception of the relation between language and thought.}},

  abstract = {We propose an algorithm for the generation of referring expressions
	that adapts the approach of Areces et al. (2008, 2011) to include
	overspecification and probabilities learned from corpora. After introducing
	the algorithm, we discuss how probabilities required as input can
	be computed for any given domain for which a suitable corpus of REs
	is available, and how the probabilities can be adjusted for new scenes
	in the domain using a machine learning approach. We exemplify how
	to compute probabilities over the GRE3D7 corpus of Viethen (2011).
	The resulting algorithm is able to generate different referring expressions
	for the same target with a frequency similar to that observed in
	corpora. We empirically evaluate the new algorithm over the GRE3D7
	corpus, and show that the probability distribution of the generated
	referring expressions match the one found in the corpus with high
	accuracy.},
