  abstract = {The problem of generating referring expressions (GRE) is an important
    task in natural language generation. In this paper, we advocate for
    the use of logical languages in the output of the content determination
    phase (i.e., when the relevant features of the object to be referred
    are selected). Many difeerent logics can be used for this and we
    argue that, for a particular application, the actual choice shall
    constitute a compromise between expressive power (how many objects
    can be distinguished), computational complexity (how dificult it
    is to determine the content) and realizability (how often will the
    selected content
    be realized to an idiomatic expression). We show that well-known results
    from the area of computational logic can then be transferred to GRE.
    Moreover, our approach is orthogonal to previous proposals and we
    illustrate this by generalizing well-known content-determination
    algorithms to make them parametric on the logic employed.},

Finally, by the use of a paradigm case, a theory of reference in terms of a cognitive theory of semantics is advanced in which it is shown that a semantic decision, i.e., the choice of a word, is made so as to differentiate an intended referent from some perceived or inferred set of alternatives. The implications include an altered conception of meaning, a statement of the relative information in words and in pictures, a hypothesis about the redundancy of the postulation of deep structure, and revised conception of the relation between language and thought.}},

The corpus was produced in collaborative communication involving speaker-hearer pairs, and includes situations of reference that are arguably under-represented in similar work. Stars2 is intended as an incremental contribution to the research in REG and related fields, and it may be used both as training/test data for algorithms of this kind, and also to gain further insights into reference phenomena in general, with a particular focus on the issue of attribute choice in referential overspecification.",
