\section{Learning to describe new objects from corpora}\label{sec:learning}

In the previous section we presented an algorithm that assumes that each relation R used in a referring expressions has a known probability of use R.\puse. In this section, we describe how to calculate these probabilities from corpora.  The general set up is the following: we assume available a corpus of REs associated to different scenes that are prototypical of the domain in which the GRE algorithm will have to operate.   We show first how to calculate R.\puse\ values for those scenes for which a corpus of REs is available.  We then show how to generalize these values to 
other scenes in the domain, using a machine learning algorithm.   We will exemplify the methodology using the GRE3D7 corpus which we introduce in the next section. 

\subsection{A corpus of referring expressions}

In what follows we will use the GRE3D7 corpus of~\shortcite{viet:gene11} which consists of 4480 referring expressions. This is the largest corpus of distinguishing descriptions developed to date. The REs in the corpus describe objects in 32 3D scenes. Each scene contains a small number of simple objects (cubes and balls), and the individual descriptions were elicited in the absence of a preceding discourse. The stimulus scenes are designed in a way that encourage the use of relations between objects, but do not require them. For a detailed description of the collection procedure see~\cite[Chapter 5]{viet:gene11}. A sample scene used in the corpus collection is shown in Figure~\ref{GRE3D7-stimulus} (the target object is marked with an arrow). Table~\ref{corpus-distribution} shows the REs that appear in the corpus for Figure~\ref{GRE3D7-stimulus} together with their total number of occurrences and the percentage these totals represent.  

\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
Referring expressions & Occurrences & Percentage \\
\hline
green ball & 91 & 65.00\% \\
small green ball & 23 & 16.43\% \\
small green ball on top of large blue cube & 8 & 5.71\% \\
green ball on top of blue cube & 5 & 3.57\% \\
green ball on top of large blue cube & 5 & 3.57\% \\
small green ball on top of blue cube & 2 & 1.43\% \\
ball on top of cube & 1 & 0.71\% \\
small green ball on top of large blue cube to the left & 1 & 0.71\% \\
small ball on top large cube & 1 & 0.71\% \\
green ball on top & 1 & 0.71\% \\
small ball on top of small cube & 1 & 0.71\% \\
green ball on top of cube & 1 & 0.71\% \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Referring expressions produced by the subjects for Figure~\ref{GRE3D7-stimulus}\label{corpus-distribution}}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The REs in the corpus were produced by 294 participants. Each participant produced 16 referring expressions corresponding to 16 different scenes. In this way, 140 descriptions for each of the 32 scenes were obtained, resulting in a corpus of 4480 REs in total. 

Defining a balanced set of stimuli scenes is extremely hard as different variables like the exact size of the objects, their spatial distribution or the color assignment can elicit particular reactions on the subjects.  Still, the GRE3D7 corpora provides a complex and interesting data set to study the choices made by different subjects when selecting the content of REs. 


\subsection{Calculating \puse\ when a corpus for the scene is available}

Suppose we want to automatically generate REs for target $t$ in a given scene, and that we do have available a corpus $C$ of REs for $t$ in that scene (this is exactly the kind of information we find in the GRE3D7 corpus).  We will use the REs in $C$ first to define the relational model 
used by the algorithm, and then estimate \puse\ for each of the relations in the model as the percentage of REs in which the relation appears.  I.e., 
\begin{equation}\label{eq1}
R.\puse = \frac{\# \mbox{ of REs in $C$ in which R appears}}{\# \mbox{ of REs in $C$}}.
\end{equation}
This estimation is overlysimplified and, for example, it does not differentiate between the properties of a target and the properties of a landmark object used in a relational RE to complete the description of the target.  But it is extremely easy to compute, and we will see in Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} that it already produces natural REs that match those found in the corpus. 

To clarify the computation of R.\puse\ and the model $\gM$ associated to each scene we list the required steps in detail, and discuss how we carried them out in the GRE3D7 corpus.

\vspace*{-.4cm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Tokenize the referring expressions and call the set of tokens $T$. In particular, multi-word expressions like ``on top of'' should be matched to a single token \emph{ontop}.\\[-2em]

\item Remove hyperonyms from $T$. E.g., if both \emph{cube} and \emph{thing} appear in $T$, delete \emph{thing}.\\[-2em]

\item If the set of tokens obtained in the previous steps contains synonyms normalize them to a representative in the synonym class, and call the resulting set $\REL$; it will be the signature of the model $\gM$ used by the algorithm. E.g., the tokens \emph{little} and \emph{small} are both represented by the token \emph{small}.\\[-2em]

\item For each scene, define $\gM$ such that the interpretation $\interp{\cdot}$ ensures that all the REs in the corpus are REs in the model. E.g., the $\el$ formulas corresponding to the REs in Table~\ref{corpus-distribution} should all denote the target in the model $\gM$ depicted in 
Figure~\ref{GRE3D7-stimulus-graph}.\\[-2em]

\item For each R $\in \REL$ compute R.\puse\ using~(\ref{eq1}).\\[-2em]

\end{enumerate}

%For example, the signature of the model shown in Figure~\ref{GRE3D7-stimulus-graph} is \{\emph{small}, \emph{large}, \emph{blue}, \emph{green}, \emph{ball}, \emph{cube}, \emph{ontop}, \emph{below}, \emph{rightof}, \emph{leftof}\}.

Steps 1-5 above are easy to carry out (actually, the tokenization and normalization steps were already done in the GRE3D7 corpus). Starting from the scene in Figure~\ref{GRE3D7-stimulus} and the corresponding corpus shown in Table~\ref{corpus-distribution}, the resulting signature and their associated \puse\ are listed in Table~\ref{probability-of-use}. 

\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
Token & Probability of use \\
\hline
ball & 1.0 \\
green & 0.978 \\
small & 0.257 \\
on-top & 0.178 \\ 
cube & 0.178 \\
blue & 0.15 \\
large & 0.107 \\
left & 0.007 \\
top & 0.186 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Probabilities of use of the tokens from the corpora in Table~\ref{GRE3D7-stimulus}\label{probability-of-use}}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Notice that the value R.\puse\ obtained in this way should be interpreted as the probability of using R to describe the target in model $\gM$.  
For that reason, for example, the value of \emph{ball}.\puse\ is 1, while the value of \emph{cube}.\puse is 0.178.  These probabilities will not be useful to describe different targets in different scenes.  We will see how we can use them to obtain values for new targets and scenes using a machine learning approach in the next section.  Perhaps not surprisingly, using these values the algorithm generates REs matching the ones found in the corpus.  More interestingly, as we discuss in Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} it does so with a distribution that matches the one found in the corpus and, as Table~\ref{XXX} shows, even the generated REs not found in the corpus are natural.    

%As we will show in Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}, the algorithm will be able to generate REs like ``small ball on top of blue cube'' to describe the target in Figure~\ref{corpus-distribution}, which could have naturally appeared in the corpora. 

\subsection{Calculating \puse\ for scenes without corpora}

If there is no corpus on the target scene we need a corpus that uses the same kind of attributes and we apply the following methodology. In order to generalize from the corpora we need it to be annotated with the kinds of attributes that their tokens represent. In the domain of the corpus GRE3D7 we use the kind of attributes defined in~\cite{viet:gene11}. 

The learning was done with WEKA~\cite{Hall:WEK09}, training on all the stimuli excluding the scene that we intend to describe. We use linear regression to learn the function of probability of use for each word in the vocabulary. For a given scene, we replace the variables of the obtained function by the values of the features in the scene. In order to do the learning process we use the following attributes extracted automatically from the model:  

\begin{itemize}
\item target-has: if the target element has the property.
\item count-prop-rel: count of properties plus relations that the target has.
\item noun-target-has: count of nouns that the target has
\item adjective-target-has: count of adjectives that the target has.
\item relations-target-has: count of the relations that the target has.
\item distractor-has: if the distractor neighbor has the property.
\item discernibility: in the discernibility as defined in~\cite{gatt:nond11}, it is calculated like 1/count of time that the word appear in the model.
\end{itemize}


%=============================

%Note that we learn idem probabilities for green and blue, because they are in the same group, but the algorithm is not going to use both, because one target element has not both properties, it the algorithm see in the model.
