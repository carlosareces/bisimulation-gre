 abstract = {The problem of generating referring expressions (GRE) is
an important
       task in natural language generation. In this paper, we advocate for
       the use of logical languages in the output of the content determination
       phase (i.e., when the relevant features of the object to be referred
       are selected). Many difeerent logics can be used for this and we
       argue that, for a particular application, the actual choice shall
       constitute a compromise between expressive power (how many objects
       can be distinguished), computational complexity (how dificult it
       is to determine the content) and realizability (how often will the
       selected content
       be realized to an idiomatic expression). We show that well-known results
       from the area of computational logic can then be transferred to GRE.
       Moreover, our approach is orthogonal to previous proposals and we
       illustrate this by generalizing well-known content-determination
       algorithms to make them parametric on the logic employed.},

	in the literature. Our main tools are suitable notions of bisimulation.
	While an elegant notion of bisimulation exists for N_\subseteq, the
	required bisimulation for N_= is rather involved. We propose a simple
	extension of N_= with a universal modality that we call N_=(E), which
	comes together with a natural notion of bisimulation. We also investigate
	the complexity of the satisfiability problem for N_\subseteq and
	N_=(E).},
