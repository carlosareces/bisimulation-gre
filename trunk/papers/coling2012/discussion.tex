In this paper we extend Areces et al.~\shortcite{arec2:2008:Areces} algorithm to generate REs similar to those produced by humans. The extensions done to the algorithm are based on two observations, on the one hand, there is no ordering of properties that is able to generate all the REs produced by humans and humans frequently overspecify their REs. We obtain an algorithm that is able to generate a large proportion of the overspecified REs found in corpora without generating bad referring expressions.
