\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusion}

Our short term plans of future work include evaluating our algorithm on a more complex domain such as Open Domain Folksonimies~\cite{pacheco-duboue-dominguez:2012:NAACL-HLT}. Moreover, we also plan to explore interactive corpora such as the GIVE Corpus~\cite{GarGarKolStr10} where we have informally observed that, under time pressure, people first produce an underspecified RE that includes salient properties such as ``the red button'' and then, in a following utterance, they add ``to the left of the lamp'' identifying the target uniquely.
