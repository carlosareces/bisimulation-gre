\section{Generation of referring expressions}\label{sec:gre}

\fxnote{Carlso working here}

Automatically generate referential expresion is a goal of a lot's of systems, but the expresion that they generate in the most of cases are deterministics and not overspecified, or sobrespecified when they tell every attributes that the thing has.
The algorithm of~\cite{areces08} is based in modal logics for adquisition of referential expresion...

In the first part of this paper we resume the previos work in the area, after that we present the novell algorithm, in the tirth part we apply the algorithm to a manual corpus, generate with the algorithm and compare results, after that we generate for another picture and show the very good results. Two metrics are studied for the test, precision and recall. We also give some future lines of investigation about this topic.
