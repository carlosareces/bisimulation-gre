\section{Analisis of Errors}
\label{sec:error}

We analize and clasify the errors founded in the TUNA-corpus, the clasification is the following:

Was not RE is when the RE contains attibutes that are not in the model (except for other considered separatelly), or wen the person did a mistake wen give the RE. In this category also put when a person name twice a characteristic like a color.\\ 
Ok means that the system generates the same RE that the person generates with the higher frequency.\\
Contain other means that the RE generated for the human contain other in the attributes-set, and the system couldn't generates because has not other in the model.\\
Sys doesn't generates is when the system in the 100 execusion not generates the RE exactly like a person does.\\
Sys renerates in another position not the first one frequency and taking into account until position 20.\\

In the table we show the diferentes clases of errors with quantities and porcentages for furniture and people separatelly.
